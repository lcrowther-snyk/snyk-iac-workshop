# Introduction to Snyk IaC Workshop


Snyk Infrastructure as Code allows you to find and fix vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform and CloudFormation configuration files

Developer-focused infrastructure as code security with Snyk allows you to test and monitor Terraform modules and Kubernetes YAML, JSON, and Helm charts to detect configuration issues that could open your deployments to attack and malicious behavior.

In this **hands-on** workshop we will achieve the follow:

* [Step 1 Fork a GitHub IaC repository](#step-1-fork-a-github-iac-repository)
* [Step 2 Configure GitHub Integration](#step-2-configure-github-integration) 
* [Step 3 Add project to find vulnerabilities](#step-3-add-project-to-find-vulnerabilities)
* [Step 4 Test using the Snyk CLI - Terraform Files](#step-4-test-using-the-snyk-cli---terraform-files)
* [Step 5 Test using the Snyk CLI - AWS CloudFormation files](#step-5-test-using-the-snyk-cli---aws-cloudformation-files)
* [Step 6 Test using the Snyk CLI - Kubernetes YAML files](#step-6-test-using-the-snyk-cli---kubernetes-yaml-files)
* [Step 7 View Snyk IaC Rules](#step-7-view-snyk-iac-rules)

## Prerequisites

* public GitHub account - http://github.com
* git CLI - https://git-scm.com/downloads
* snyk CLI - https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003812538-Install-the-Snyk-CLI
* Registered account on Snyk App - http://app.snyk.io

# Workshop Steps

_Note: It is assumed your using a mac for these steps but it should also work on windows or linux with some modifications to the scripts potentially_

## Step 1 Fork a GitHub IaC repository

Navigate to the following GitHub repo - https://github.com/papicella/snyk-iac-workshop

* Click on the "**Fork**" button
* Ensure you are forking this repo to your public GitHub account
* Click done

## Step 2 Configure GitHub Integration

First we need to connect Snyk to GitHub so we can import our Repository. Do so by:

* Login to http://app.snyk.io Sign up if you haven't already.
* Navigating to Integrations -> Source Control -> GitHub
* Fill in your Account Credentials to Connect your GitHub Account.

## Step 3 Add project to find vulnerabilities

* Before we get started we need to make sure IaC is enabled navigate to "**Settings -> Infrastructure as code**" and ensure it is enabled as shown below.

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/bRLppWW/snyk-iac-7.png)

Now that Snyk is connected to your GitHub Account, import the Repo into Snyk as a Project.

* Navigate to Projects 
* Click "**Add Project**" then select "**GitHub**"
* Click on the Repo you forked "**snyk-iac-workshop**"

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/pWJW1VK/snyk-iac-1.png)

__Note: Once complete you should see various IaC scans as shown below_

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/YNC5rfd/snyk-iac-2.png)

* Go ahead and click on "**big_data.tf**" terraform file as shown below

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/DKY911V/snyk-iac-3.png)

For each Vulnerability, Snyk displays the following ordered by Line no:

1. Each Vulnerability grouped by line no and severity 
1. Each Vulnerability links to the Snyk policy it was defined against including the path to the issue, what the issue is, the impact and how to resolve it
1. The ability to ignore issues you wish to remove from the list

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/3dJHzrm/snyk-iac-4.png)

Note: We will resolve some of these issues shortly for now just browse through some of them to get familiar with what was raised and why including clicking on the Snyk Policy links

## Step 4 Test using the Snyk CLI - Terraform Files

Snyk tests and monitors your Terraform files from your source code repositories, guiding you with advice for how you can better secure your cloud environment--catching misconfigurations before you push to production and helping you to fix them

In addition to the Snyk App UI we also have, snyk - CLI and build-time tool to find & fix known vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies and IaC configuration files. 

_Note: Please ensure you have the latest version of the Snyk CLI installed a version equal to or greater than the version below. https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli_

```bash
$ snyk --version
1.675.0
```

* Authorize the Snyk CLI with your account as follows

```bash
$ snyk auth

Now redirecting you to our auth page, go ahead and log in,
and once the auth is complete, return to this prompt and you'll
be ready to start using snyk.

If you can't wait use this url:
https://snyk.io/login?token=ff75a099-4a9f-4b3d-b75c-bf9847672e9c&utm_medium=cli&utm_source=cli&utm_campaign=cli&os=darwin&docker=false


Your account has been authenticated. Snyk is now ready to be used.
```

* Clone your forked repository as shown below. You would use your own GitHub repo here instead of the one shown below

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/papicella/snyk-iac-workshop
Cloning into 'snyk-iac-workshop'...

```

* Change to the "**snyk-iac-workshop**" directory

```bash
$ cd snyk-iac-workshop
```

* At this point let's go ahead and test "**big_data.tf**" to do that issue a command as shown below. In this example we are testing that file itself by specifically referring to it in the command. 

```bash
$ snyk iac test ./terraform/big_data.tf

That's one less issue to worry about and when our Cloud SQL database is provisioned it will have SSL enabled making it for more secure than it previously was.

Go ahead and fix others if you have time and optionally commit your changes back to the GitHub repo if you like

* To output the test format as JSON issue a command as follows. This provides more detailed information including links to issue references as well as the ability to upload the data into other system for reporting purposes.

* With Snyk Infrastructure as Code, you can scan both your static configuration files and Terraform Plan output using the CLI, [Test your Terraform files with our CLI tool](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360013723877-Test-your-Terraform-files-with-our-CLI-tool).

Terraform Plan is the step run between writing your configuration files and deploying those changes.

Note: terraform plan identifies the changes that need to be made to your target environment in order to match your desired state.

If you have written a custom terraform module and are referencing it in your deployment, then it will be included in the terraform plan output and scanned   accordingly.

This means the Terraform plan output provides a complete artefact to be scanned from a security perspective. 

_Note: For this workshop we won't be doing a terraform plan scan but it's important to know we can do that_

## Step 5 Test using the Snyk CLI - AWS CloudFormation files

_Note: Please ensure you have the latest version of the Snyk CLI installed a version equal to or greater than the version below. https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli_

```bash
$ snyk --version
1.675.0
```

Snyk tests and monitors CloudFormation files from source code repositories. It gives advice on how to better secure cloud environments by catching misconfigurations before they are pushed to production along with assistance on how best to fix them

* Run the following IaC scan of any files inside the folder "**CloudFormation**". This will pick up all the IaC config files which exist in this directory in our case we have two files

```bash
$ snyk iac test ./CloudFormation/

## Step 6 Test using the Snyk CLI - Kubernetes YAML files

Snyk tests and monitors Kubernetes configurations stored in your source code repositories and provides information, tips, and tricks to better secure a Kubernetes environment--catching misconfigurations before they are pushed to production as well as providing fixes for vulnerabilities

Snyk Infrastructure as Code for Kubernetes supports:

1. Deployments, Pods and Services.
1. CronJobs, Jobs, StatefulSet, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, and ReplicationController
1. Helm Charts

* Let's scan our Kubernetes YAML file which is just a basic K8s deployment as shown below

```bash
$ snyk iac test ./Kubernetes/employee-K8s.yaml

* Edit the file "**./Kubernetes/employee-K8s.yaml**" and add "**securityContext > runAsNonRoot**" as shown below.

```yaml
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true

          imagePullPolicy: Always
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

## Step 7 View Snyk IaC Rules

Snyk IaC has a comprehensive set of security rules across AWS, Azure, GCP & Kubernetes with support for Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Helm configuration formats. The details of these issues, their impact, and how to fix them are all built-in to Snyk IaC, so developers get feedback directly in their own tools. For reference, we have also documented the security rules that we support for each provider below, along with relevant benchmarks and authoritative third-party references
